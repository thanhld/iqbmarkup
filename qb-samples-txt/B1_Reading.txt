Questions {fromq} – {toq}
For each question, choose the correct answer.

There are descriptions of eight clubs. 


Activity clubs

Do you want to know about international events? We meet once a week for an informal discussion. Each week we watch a film from around the world and/ or invite speakers to help us understand recent events. At our next meeting we are showing a film about earthquake rescue teams.
B. Party Plus
At Party Plus, we are looking for new people to help us. We organize street parties and concerts to raise money for local charities. It’s challenging work, and you have to work with a wide range of people, but you’ll have a lot to offer future employers and you’ll make a difference!
C. Nature lovers
Are you interested in nature? Our group has been exploring the wildlife of the city for over 100 years! We organize talks from experts on the animals and plants around us. We also work in small groups to think of ways to improve life for the animals and people in our city!
D. A world of food
We can teach you to prepare delicious dishes! Our trainers come from five countries, and they love to share their recipes and the history of their cultures. This class will teach you how to create wonderful food in your own kitchen. You never know, you might decide to become a professional chef one day!
E. Games and chat
We meet once a week to play computer games. We give our views on new games and talk about games past and present. We also organize trips to game shows to see how designers come up with new ideas and create new games. You’ll discover a whole new world!
F. Come dine with me
We meet regularly to visit restaurants and enjoy eating delicious food from all over the world. We also invite chefs from other countries to tell us about how food is grown and prepared where they come from. There’s usually quite a large group of us, so it’s a wonderful way to meet people. 
G. Action!
We are a film club, but we don’t watch films – we make them! We’re always looking for new people with interesting ideas. You will do activities in small groups, so it’s a great way to learn new skills and make friends. We also organize regular trips to film studios to see how the professionals do things. 
H. City explorers
Get out and about with City explorers! We explore our own city and produce information guides so that visitors can enjoy it too. We also produce maps of the city, past and present, showing how it’s changed. We often get together with groups from other towns and cities to compare information and experiences.

The people below all want to find a new free-time activity.

Questions  {fromq} – {toq}
Read the text and the questions below. For each question from {fromq}-{toq}, choose the correct answer A, B, C or D.

The Hotel under the Sea
Want to sleep under the sea? The company Planet Ocean has plans for an exciting underwater hotel, which they hope to build in locations all over the world.
The hotel won’t be large, with only 12 guest rooms, plus a restaurant. Guests will get to the hotel in a lift – so no diving or getting wet! The hotel will float 10 metres under the ocean, although it will be attached to the sea bed to prevent it from moving too far. Because it won’t be very deep under the water, the sun will shine down and provide light. Guests will get great close-up views of the fish and other sea creatures, which won’t be bothered by the hotel and so won’t make any effort to avoid it. 
The hotel’s design, with clear plastic walls, means guests will be able to see the sea and all the creatures that live there around, above and below them in their rooms. They will almost get the feeling that they are swimming in the ocean. The luxury rooms will have a shower, TV and even the internet. The restaurant will serve high-quality meals. As you might expect, Planet Ocean want to encourage people to eat less fish, so guests won’t find any on the menu. What’s more surprising is that the atmosphere will be silent, so guests will have to imagine the sound of the ocean around them. 
The hotel won’t be cheap to build and it won’t be cheap to stay in. But the designers are especially proud of the fact that it will be environmentally friendly. It will use electricity, of course, but it will produce its own, and won’t disturb ocean life at all. In fact, the designers hope some sea creatures will build their homes on parts of the building, which will bring real benefits to the underwater world. 
Planet Ocean’s future designs include a moving hotel. It perhaps sounds like this will work in the same way as a cruise ship, but this is not the case. In fact, rather than moving between continents and countries, it will stay within a single country’s waters, but only occasionally change positions around its coast. 
//
Question 11. What do we learn about the hotel?
C. It will only have a small number of rooms.
A. Guests will have to swim down to get to it.
B. Its lights will shine into the sea so guests can see the fish.
D. Fish and other sea creatures will be scared of it. 

Question 12. What might guests find strange about staying at the hotel?
D. being unable to hear the ocean.
A. swimming from their rooms into the ocean
B. having ocean life in their room
C. enjoying a meal of freshly caught fish


Question 13. What is the best thing about the hotel, according to the designers?
C. It won’t cause any damage to the environment.
A. It won’t cost much to build.
B. It won’t use much electricity.
D. Fish and other sea creatures won’t come very close to it.

Question 14. Planet Ocean’s moving hotel will
A. rarely move from one site to another.
B. travel between various countries.
C. be similar to a type of cruise ship.
D. remain close to the coast of each continent. 

Question 15. What might a guest in this hotel say?
B. It’s great to stay in such a beautiful hotel that is also good for the planet.
A. It’s very expensive, but the facilities are quite basic and the windows are too small to see outside.
C. Seeing the fish up close is amazing, but it’s a shame that the hotel disturbs sea life.
D. It’s a great idea, and I love the fact that it can move around and travel to different locations.

Questions  {fromq} – {toq}
Five sentences have been removed from the text. 
For each question from {fromq} – {toq}, choose the correct answer. 

A She realized after a while that they were bees flying after her. 
B She opened the door and saw a huge number of bees. 
C She was very much looking forward to having a slice. 
D He arrived just half an hour later. 
E Although it wasn’t damaged, Lisa didn’t feel very hungry any more! 

Bees, bees, bees
Most people enjoy seeing bees in gardens and parks, but it can be scary when they're flying together in large numbers, and it can be even more frightening if they come a bit too close!
A few years ago, Lisa Turnbull was in her home in York. She had made a cake and left it on the kitchen table. (.........). But when she opened the kitchen window to help the cake cool more quickly, she unfortunately didn't notice the large number of bees flying around in her back garden. A few minutes later, Lisa heard a loud noise coming from her kitchen. (.........).  The bees had left their old home and were looking for a new one. It seems that the queen bee, which controls all the others, had fancied a bit of cake and landed on it. She was followed by 15,000 others! Luckily, Lisa knew a bit about bees, so she knew they weren't dangerous and she didn't need to be afraid. She calmly closed the door and called a local beekeeper who found the situation very amusing and took the bees away. (.........) . 
Last summer, John Norton from Manchester had a similar experience with a large number of bees. He was driving home after a long day at work when he noticed thousands of insects following his car. (.........).  She stopped his car, hoping that they would continue flying on and leave him in peace. However, when he stopped the car they landed on the back of it and stayed there. Feeling rather nervous, John used his phone to look online and find the phone number of a local beekeeper. (.........). It turned out that the queen bee had flown into the boot of the car while John was putting some shopping into it. When he closed the boot, she was stuck inside, so when he drove off, the rest of the bees followed. They somehow knew where their queen was even though they couldn't see her. John stayed in his car and didn't get out until the beekeeper had safely removed all the bees which took over three hours! That's a good excuse for being late home!
