You are going to read a magazine article about a new therapy. For questions 1-6, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text.
THE NATURAL BREAK
These days, people fill their days with work, socialising and family commitments. We have lunch and sometimes dinner on the go and have to grab some time for exercise. On top of this, many people are working well into their 60s and 70s. This can leave very little time to unwind, leading to an increase in health problems. In some instances, people medicate without really needing to. Wouldn't it be better for us to simply get back to nature?
In fact, this is why The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has decided to promote well-being in their new scheme, which encourages doctors to send patients to work on vegetable patches and herb gardens. It is thought that this would be helpful to all of us in time — the stressed city worker or the busy parent — but for now, the aim is to target people who are feeling the strain the most.
At one such garden in Highgate, North London, the local hospital has teamed up with the allotment association to create a garden for patients to enjoy, which attracts insects, bees and butterflies. Another project, in Barnsley, in the north of England, involves people who have been advised by their doctor to both increase their social interaction and do more light exercise. In these two initiatives, increasing happiness is at the top of the list. Additionally, a national garden festival is getting involved. A garden from the Chelsea Flower Show will be moved to a hospital for patients to walk in and enjoy. 
Gardening is good for the body as a whole. This is due to the amount and type of exercise done. Lifting pots will strengthen arms and using trowels involves movement of the wrists and hands. Then, there's the fresh air. Who doesn't feel the benefits of taking a deep breath in nature? Gardeners are known to have a reduced level of the hormone cortisol; having less of this hormone goes hand in hand with better sleep and lower stress levels. The activity doesn’t really get any negative press.
And it doesn't stop at gardens. Doctors are also being instructed to encourage patients to take up hobbies. Art classes, ballroom dancing and jogging can all play a part in making someone feel happier, so that we depend less on medication to sort out our problems. The added bonus is that when people get moving they get fitter as well.
And let's not forget the social side of all of this. Time to yourself doesn’t mean you have to be alone; rather, that you are actually deciding to take part in something you enjoy without a sense of necessity. Gardening and the like promote friendship and teamwork, which in turn lead to support.
When things get too hectic and your life is full of things you'd rather not do, head to a garden, if only for a few minutes. It could change your day for the better!

You are going to read an article about trips for school children. Six sentences have been removed from the article. Choose from the sentences A - F the one which fits each gap (7-12). 
Field trips for school children
For many years, school children in the US have been taken on ‘field trips’ to cultural institutions such as museums of art and of science, as well as theatres, zoos and historical sites.
Despite these trips involving some expense and disruption to class timetables, educators arrange them in the belief that schools exist not only to teach economically useful skills, but also to produce civilised young people who appreciate the arts and culture. (7) _______ So you could say that taking school students on field trips is a means of giving everyone equal access to their cultural heritage.
However, there have been increasing signs in recent years that the attitude towards field trips is changing, with the number of tours organised for school groups falling significantly in museums all around the country. Take the Field Museum in Chicago, for example. It used to have over 300,000 students each year through its doors. That number has dropped to below 200,000 more recently. (8)_______ A survey exploring the trend carried out by a group of school administrators found that over half the schools they asked had decided to cancel trips planned for the next academic year.
So what are the reasons for this change? The most obvious one is the issue of finance. Because there are increasing demands on their funds (computers and sports facilities aren’t cheap), schools are forced to make a difficult choice about how to spend the limited money they have. (9) _______  A significant number of school heads also consider days spent away from school a waste of time, believing that the only worthwhile use of students’ time is spent preparing for exams in the classroom.
Although school trips do still happen, the nature of these field days is also changing. Schools increasingly use trips as a treat for students who work hard, rather than as an opportunity for cultural learning. They are taken to amusement parks or sporting events instead of to museums and historical sites. (10) _______ In a recent survey, 500 Arkansas teachers were asked about the purpose of trips they organised. Older teachers were significantly more likely to believe the primary purpose of a field trip was to provide a learning experience than younger teachers, who were more likely to view the main point of a trip as fun.
But why should anybody worry if school children go on fewer trips? Those that believe this is a negative development in education would say that cultural field trips contribute to the development of students into well-educated adults who have a healthy interest in history and the arts. (11) _______
One exception is the research led by Jay P. Greene at Arkansas University. His team found that students who received a tour of an art museum significantly improved their knowledge of and ability to think critically about art. (12) _______ The researchers warn that if schools cut field trips or switch from ‘reward’ trips to less educational destinations, then valuable opportunities to broaden and enrich children’s learning experiences are lost.
A. This shift to ‘reward’ field trips could have a basis in generational differences between teachers’ reasons for organising days out of school.
B. However, there is little evidence to support this argument, as few studies into the effect of field trips have been done.
C. A similar pattern is emerging in many other areas of the country, and is set to continue.
D. Faced with this dilemma, field trips are an obvious thing to cut since they are seen by many as a luxury.
E. While there are parents who will take their children to cultural places and events in their free time, there are plenty of other children who will never have this kind of opportunity unless schools offer it.
F. They also displayed stronger historical empathy and were more likely to visit cultural institutions in the future.

You are going to read an article in which four people describe going to see an unusual annual event. For questions, choose from the people (A-D). The people may be chosen more than once.					
The world’s strangest annual events?
Four travellers talk about experiencing a very unusual event held annually around the world
A. Sadie Grossman
Last year, I was one of 30,000 people who took part in La Tomatina, an annual festival held in Buñol, Spain, during which townspeople and visitors fill the streets and take part in a tomato fight. I’ve neither laughed so hard nor feared for my life as much as I did on that day. Trucks of tomatoes were dumped in the streets, and I soon found myself picking up handfuls of squashed fruit and throwing them at whoever happened to be closest. Most people participating were considerate, but a few were not. I was thankful that I’d left my phone back at the hotel and worn clothes I didn’t mind getting ruined. I did wish I’d invested in a pair of goggles though, as being hit in the eye by a tomato meant I couldn’t see out of it very well for a couple of days. It was definitely an experience I’ll never forget, but one I have no desire to repeat!
B. Joe Haythorpe
I went with friends to the mud festival held in Boryeong, South Korea because several of them had been before, loved it and wanted to go again. The two-week event is centred on an area of Boryeong beach set up with water slides and pools to play in while covered in huge quantities of the mineral-rich mud that’s taken from the shore near the city. It’s great fun for the entire family as well as groups of friends. Apart from playing in the mud, we also attended some great concerts and shopped for mud-based skin creams. Although it’s only been going since 1998, it already attracts millions of Koreans and Western tourists annually. But if you’re considering going, book your accommodation early as room rates triple closer to the event. All in all, this festival was by far the most fun one I’ve ever been to.
C. Charlie Traynor
Cheese Rolling on Cooper’s Hill in Gloucestershire, England is the ideal activity for fans of extreme sports whether as spectators or as participants, and is definitely one of the craziest traditions I’ve ever witnessed. I watched in amazement as madly courageous men and women threw themselves down a steep hill, tumbling head over heels, while chasing a large round cheese. The cheese always gets to the bottom of the hill first, but for each race there is a prize (a cheese worth a lot of money) for the first person to do so. Thankfully, that day everyone survived without seriously hurting themselves. The event is free, but because of the large crowds, I struggled to find a place from which I could actually see much of the action or use my camera. There were also four uphill races, but they were a lot less exciting.
D. Louisa Darke
During the Monkey Buffet Festival in Lopburi, Thailand, cakes, fruit and vegetables are piled up on tables in the streets for 3000 local monkeys to enjoy. The festival was established to boost tourism in the area, and it’s worked: huge crowds now travel there from all over the world, many dressed in monkey costumes. There is traditional music, dance and sculpture, all with a monkey theme, and the monkeys themselves roam free. They have no fear of people, and we were warned that they might try to grab our phones, hats or even jewellery and run off with them. I’m glad to say they didn’t, but at one point a young monkey jumped up onto my shoulder, making me very uncomfortable. We were given sticks to protect ourselves, but I didn’t want to use one. I was glad when the monkey climbed down. However, it was very entertaining to watch the animals from a distance, happily playing and eating.
